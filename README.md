Water Quality Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on predicting and analyzing water quality using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to identify the most effective model for classifying water quality based on a range of features derived from water samples.

Overview
Water quality is a crucial indicator of environmental health and public safety. Accurate detection and prediction of water quality levels can help ensure safe drinking water and identify potential environmental risks. This project applies a wide range of machine learning techniques to develop a robust classification system for water quality assessment.
